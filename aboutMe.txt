Short bio:
I tend to push myself into challenging avenues. I learned how to fly a plane, but am seriously afraid of heights. I ride a Triumph Thunderbird 1600cc engine yet need to take anti-anxiety for the first hour of the ride. I jumped into commercial print sales to see whether or not I could muster it. Now, I’m making a decision to change the direction of my career, pursuing something that I thought I’d missed the boat on. 
I’m excited to learn everything and achieve my black belts here at Coding Dojo.
